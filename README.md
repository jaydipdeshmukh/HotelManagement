The online hotel booking aims to maintain and manage the various hotel tasks and processes. It is primarily responsible for hotel management in the database's core section. The system gives information on the various hotels that are available, as well as their current availability status. Guests can come to the website and register with the system by providing the required information.
Each registered guest can request unit reservations. The guests are given information about the availability of the units because they have requested a specific time.
This website allows the hotel management the ability to operate the entire system from a single online interface, giving them more power and flexibility. Room booking, staff management, and other hotel management services are included in this project. The manager can use the system to advertise available rooms. Customers may see and reserve rooms from the comfort of their own homes. Admin has the authority to approve or reject a customer's booking request. Other hotel services are also available for consumers to see and book. As a result, the system may be used by both consumers and management to control hotel activities on the go.
